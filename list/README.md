## List 

### Steps to use this little tool:
1. First give rights to ```index.js``` to run as exectable. Run this command in console (Unix only):\
```chmod +x index.js```
2. Run ```npm i``` to update all the dependencies
3. Run ```npm link``` to make it available in all the folders on the machine
4. Run ```nls``` to list files in the current directory or ```nls folder_path``` in any other directory

### TODO

1. Change ```!isFile()``` to ```isFolder()```
2. Add nicer coloring
3. Add help function
